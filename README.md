  # <p align="center">Note Taker

  ## Description  
The purpose of this project was to practice creating and editing Express.js routes and HTTP request methods. The application is a note taker which allows a user to create, edit, and delete notes and view stored notes again anytime without utilising local storage. Instead, the app stores the data in a remote server which responds to the application's get, post, and delete requests and sends back the appropriate notes.
